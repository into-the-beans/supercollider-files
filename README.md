# supercollider-files
A collection of SuperCollider scripts I've made. 

## [select](select.scd)
This script is meant to run on startup to give an easy way to select the server output device, boot/reboot the server, and work as a kill switch. This is my first SuperCollider script. It is meant to be used with the [TidalCycles](https://tidalcycles.org/) live programming language. 

### Planned Features
- Add a small help menu
- Add ability to remove sample paths and load samples while the server is running
- Ability to change buffers and other parameters
- Add ability to refresh audio device list without restarting
